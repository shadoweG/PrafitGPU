# ProfitGPU ðŸ“ˆ
GPU profitability counter in Java.<br>
You can compare 2 GPU's via Terminal/Command Prompt or whatever you are using by typing name and 3DMark score.<br>
I know, I know... I can make a big lively updating database but that's a lot of work for a small, little, tiny project.<br>
I hope someone find it useful ðŸ˜‰.
