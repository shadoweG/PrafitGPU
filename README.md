# ProfitGPU ðŸ“ˆ

GPU profitability counter in Java.

## Usage
You can compare 2 GPU's via Terminal/Command Prompt or whatever you are using by typing name and 3DMark score. I know, I know... I can make a big lively updating database but that's a lot of work for a small, little, tiny project. I hope someone find it useful ðŸ˜‰.
